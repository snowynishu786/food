            Vanilla is America's favorite flavor for a reason: it's simple and it goes with everything. Ice cream expert and IDFA Vice President, Cary Frye, explains, "Vanilla has long been the best-selling ice cream flavor not only because it is creamy and delicious, but also because of its ability to enhance so many other desserts and treats. It tastes great topped by whipped cream and fudge sauce in a sundae, with root beer in a float or atop a warm slice of apple pie."

            Chocolate is a crowd favorite because, like vanilla, it's versatile. Unlike vanilla, it has a lot of variations: chocolate chunk, fudge swirl, mudslide. Along with that, chocolate ice cream is a favorite of many because it can be rich or light. It can be dressed up in a sundae or eaten by itself.

            A cappuccino is an espresso-based coffee drink that originated in Italy, and is traditionally prepared with steamed milk foam. Variations of the drink involve the use of cream instead of milk, using non-dairy milks, and flavoring with cinnamon or chocolate powder.

            A mocha is a very sugary coffee drink. It contains around two shots of espresso, steamed milk, chocolate syrup (or milk), and whipped cream on top. Additionally, mochas tend to be sweet, and they are very caloric. If you see “white mocha,” it is made with white chocolate as opposed to dark/milk chocolate.

            For a Hot Macchiato, a rich and bold espresso beverage, we add a layer of steamed milk, topped with two shots of espresso, then finished with milk foam. Espresso tastes about four to six times stronger than regular coffee, so enjoying it with water creates a balanced, full-bodied beverage that will keep you runnin'.

            Iced coffee is a coffee beverage served cold. It may be prepared either by brewing coffee in the normal way and then serving it over ice or in cold milk, or by brewing the coffee cold. In hot brewing, sweeteners and flavoring may be added before cooling, as they dissolve faster.

            Cold-brew coffee, however, is made by steeping coarsely ground coffee beans in room-temperature water for six to 12 hours. This creates a coffee concentrate you mix with cold water or milk.

            Turkish coffee is a method of coffee preparation that originated in Middle Eastern and European countries, including Turkey, Iran and Greece.
